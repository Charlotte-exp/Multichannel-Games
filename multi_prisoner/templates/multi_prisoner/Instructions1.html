    <p>You are <b>Participant 1</b> in this study. The other Participant is <b>Participant 2.</b></p>
    <p>
        In each round, you and Participant 2 will simultaneously interact with each other in two tasks, Task A and Task B.
        In each task, both of you must choose between two options.
        The points you earn in each round will depend on what you and Participant 2 independently decide for each task.
        The two tasks are independent. The points you earn in either task do not depend on the decisions made in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can see the outcomes of each option that you and Participant 2 can choose from in each task in each round,
        depending on your own decision as well as Participant 2's decision.
