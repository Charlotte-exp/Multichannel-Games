    <p><b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b></p>

    <p>
        In this study, you are about to engage in <b>two simultaneous tasks with two different participants</b> who are also taking part in the same session as you.
        You will be interacting in real time with these two participants.
        The two tasks consist of many interactive rounds. In each round you will always be playing with the same two participants.
        Your bonus payment will depend on the decisions you and the other two participants make in each task.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this study, you will accumulate points (pts).
        At the end of the study, all the points you have earned will be converted to GBP at a rate of {{ Constants.pounds_per_points }} points = £1 and paid as a bonus to you 3-5 days after completing the study.
        You must stay on task at all times. Otherwise you will automatically be disconnected and get £0.
        The Prolific link for the payment will be displayed at the end of the study.
