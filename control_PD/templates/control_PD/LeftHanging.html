            To compensate for your time, you will be paid a small bonus in addition to your participation fee.
            It will be paid directly into your student bank account by the University of Exeter Finance Department.
            Please ensure your bank account details are up to date in your SRS account.
            Payment usually takes 1 to 2 weeks to come through.
