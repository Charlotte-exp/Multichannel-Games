    <p>You are <b>Participant 1</b> in this study. The other Participant is <b>Participant 2.</b></p>
    <p>
        In each round, you and Participant 2 will simultaneously interact with each other in two tasks, Task A and Task B.
        In each task, both of you must choose between two options.
        The points you earn in each round will depend on what you and Participant 2 independently decide for each task.
        The two tasks are independent. The points you earn in either task do not depend on the decisions made in the other.
        In each round and for each of the two tasks, you and the other participant are endowed with
        {{ Constants.endowment_high }} points in Task A and {{ Constants.endowment_low }} points in task B.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can see the outcomes of each option that you and Participant 2 can choose from in each task in each round,
        depending on your own decision as well as Participant 2's decision. You are using the money endowed to you in each.
